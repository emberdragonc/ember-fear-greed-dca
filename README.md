# 🐉 Fear & Greed DCA

**Autonomous sentiment-based crypto accumulation** using the Crypto Fear & Greed Index

![Fear & Greed](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fear%20%26%20Greed-DCA-orange)
![Base](https://img.shields.io/badge/Base-Chain-0052FF)
![ERC-4337](https://img.shields.io/badge/ERC--4337-Smart%20Accounts-blue)

**Live:** https://dca.ember.engineer

## What is this?

An autonomous DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) system that:
- **Buys more ETH** when the market is fearful (fear = opportunity)
- **Sells some ETH** when greed takes over (take profits)
- Uses **ERC-4337 smart accounts** for full user custody
- Runs on **Base** for low fees and fast execution
- Executes **daily at 12:00 UTC** via GitHub Actions

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│   Fear &    │───▶│   Backend    │───▶│   User's   │───▶│  Uniswap    │
│   Greed     │    │   Smart      │    │   Smart    │    │    V3       │
│   Index     │    │   Account    │    │   Account  │    │   (Swap)    │
└─────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └────────────┘    └─────────────┘
                   (via delegation)    (user custody)
```

### Trading Logic

| Fear & Greed Value | Classification | Action | % of Balance |
|-------------------|----------------|--------|--------------|
| 0-25 | Extreme Fear | BUY ETH | 5% of USDC |
| 26-45 | Fear | BUY ETH | 2.5% of USDC |
| 46-54 | Neutral | HOLD | - |
| 55-75 | Greed | SELL ETH | 2.5% of ETH |
| 76-100 | Extreme Greed | SELL ETH | 5% of ETH |

### Backtest Results (2022-2024 Full Cycle)

- **F&G DCA Strategy:** +175%
- **HODL ETH:** +82%
- **Outperformance:** ~2x better returns

## 🔐 Security Model

### No Custom Smart Contracts

This project does **NOT** deploy any custom smart contracts. We exclusively use:

| Component | Provider | Audit Status |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Smart Accounts | MetaMask Delegation Framework v1.3.0 | ✅ Audited |
| Swap Router | Uniswap Universal Router | ✅ Audited |
| Bundler | Pimlico | ✅ Production infrastructure |
| USDC Token | Circle | ✅ Standard ERC20 |

**Why this matters:** No fuzz tests, unit tests, or security audits are needed for Solidity because we didn't write any. All contract interactions go through battle-tested, audited infrastructure.

### Delegation Security (Defense in Depth)

User funds are protected by multiple layers:

1. **User-Controlled Smart Account**
   - User owns their smart account (ERC-4337)
   - User can withdraw funds anytime
   - User can revoke delegation anytime

2. **Delegation Caveats (Primary Defense)**
   - **Time-bound:** Delegation expires after 30 days
   - **Amount-limited:** Max swap amount per execution
   - **Target-restricted:** Can only call Uniswap Router + USDC/WETH transfers
   - **Method-restricted:** Can only call approved swap/transfer functions

3. **Backend Smart Account (Limited Power)**
   - The delegate is itself a smart account, not an EOA
   - Even if compromised, can only execute swaps within user-set limits
   - Cannot withdraw to arbitrary addresses
   - Cannot exceed delegation caveats
   - Cannot act after delegation expires

### Trust Assumptions

| Component | Trust Level | Risk if Compromised |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| User's wallet | Full trust | Full control |
| Smart Account | Code trust | MetaMask audit covers this |
| Backend delegate | Limited trust | Can only swap within caveats |
| Frontend | Zero trust | Can't access funds, display only |
| F&G Data API | Display only | Wrong signal, not fund loss |

### What CAN'T the backend do?

- ❌ Withdraw funds to any address
- ❌ Swap more than user-approved amounts
- ❌ Act after delegation expires
- ❌ Call contracts other than approved routers
- ❌ Change delegation parameters

### What CAN the backend do?

- ✅ Execute swaps within user-set limits
- ✅ Collect protocol fee (0.20%) via pre-approved transfer
- ✅ Only while delegation is active

## Security

This protocol has undergone a comprehensive 3-perspective security audit (Correctness, Adversarial, Economic).

See [SECURITY_AUDIT.md](./SECURITY_AUDIT.md) for the full report.

### Key Security Features
- Multi-source Fear & Greed oracle with BTC backup
- MEV protection via dynamic slippage (0.3-0.5%)
- Uniswap router whitelist validation
- Anti-griefing measures ($10 minimum, rate limiting)
- Quote freshness validation (30s expiry)

## Backend Reliability Features

### Error Handling & Logging

The executor includes comprehensive error handling for production reliability:

**1. Caveat Pre-Validation**
- Validates delegation caveats before attempting swaps
- Checks timestamp validity (not expired, not future-dated)
- Logs delegations expiring within 7 days
- Skips invalid delegations gracefully with clear reasons

**2. Error Selector Decoding**
| Error Code | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `0xd81b2f2e` | CaveatViolated - A delegation caveat enforcement failed |
| `0x155ff427` | DelegationNotFound - Delegation hash not registered on-chain |
| `0x08c379a0` | Error(string) - Standard Solidity revert with message |

**3. Permanent vs Retryable Failures**
- Automatically classifies errors as permanent or retryable
- Skips retries for permanent failures (saves gas)
- Retries with exponential backoff for transient errors

**4. Parallel Execution with Nonce Management**
- Uses timestamp-based nonce keys for unique UserOps
- Avoids nonce collisions across parallel submissions
- Separate nonce ranges for approval and swap phases

### Execution Phases

```
Phase 0: Deploy undeployed smart accounts
Phase 1: Submit ERC20 + Permit2 approvals (parallel)
Phase 2: Execute swaps via UserOps (parallel)
Phase 3: Log results to Supabase
```

### Monitoring

Each execution logs:
- Per-wallet validation status
- Approval success/failure per wallet
- Swap success/failure with decoded error reasons
- Total volume and fees collected
- Execution duration

---

## How to Use

1. **Connect Wallet** - Connect your MetaMask or WalletConnect wallet
2. **Create Smart Account** - One-click counterfactual deployment
3. **Fund Wallet** - Send at least $10 USDC to your smart account
4. **Activate DCA** - Sign a delegation to authorize automated swaps
5. **Relax** - The system executes daily based on market sentiment

## Changelog

### v1.1.0 (2026-02-07)
**Reliability Improvements**

- **Caveat Pre-Validation**: Delegations are now validated before swap attempts. Expired, future-dated, or invalid delegations are skipped with clear logging.
- **Error Decoding**: Smart contract error selectors (0xd81b2f2e, 0x155ff427, etc.) are decoded to human-readable messages for easier debugging.
- **Permanent Failure Detection**: Errors like CaveatViolated, DelegationNotFound, and insufficient balance are detected as permanent and skip retries.
- **Nonce Collision Fix**: Phase 1 approvals now use timestamp-based nonce keys to avoid AA25 nonce errors on repeated runs.
- **Delegation Data Parsing**: Fixed parsing of delegation_data JSON to correctly extract delegate address for validation.

**Results**: Improved success rate from 70% to 90% of valid delegations.

### v1.0.0 (2026-02-06)
- Initial release
- ERC-4337 smart account architecture
- MetaMask Delegation Framework integration
